   			<h2>Welcome to the party page!</h2>
	  		<p>Check it out, I made a website for this! So it's all fancy and official looking.<br> I'm throwing a big murder mystery party on the 19th of October and I want to fill this beautiful event space with all of my friends dressed in crazy costumes and have a grand old murder mystery. If you're just looking to buy a ticket, check out <a href="tickets.html">tickets</a>. If you have questions about what this is all about, I hope the following sections answer them.</p>

   			<h2>So....whats a murder mystery anyway?</h2>
            <p>There are a lot of ways to run a good murder mystery, and some of them are very different from each other. In this one, the actual murder mystery takes a back seat to creating a general on theme party ambiance. When you arrive you'll be given a character with their own story, goals, and relationships. Having a character serves three purposes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It gives you a reason to talk to people at the party you might not otherwise have talked to.</li>
              <li>It helps create a cool ambiance, so that you really feel like you're in a Dracula/Gatsby style speakeasy</li>
              <li>Roleplaying is fun! Enjoy trying to talk and act like a person at an exclusive late night party for monsters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the characters at the murder mystery might care about the whodunnit, but a large chunk of them will be too busy with their own subplots to bother with the titular riddle. After all... that's somebody elses job, right?</p>

   			<h2>I'm in! What's next?</h2>
            <p>First up, turns out throwing parties like this is expensive, so there is a cover charge. This is a shitty unsecure website I built in like 2 days, so you'll have to go <a href="tickets.html">here</a> to actually purchase your ticket. Prices go up as we get closer because getting your ticket early helps me plan better and communicate with the venue hosting us better. Once you have your ticket, it's time to come up with your costume! The theme is a monstrous, 20's inspired speakeasy. We want to combine classic Gatsby/prohibition with classic halloween monsters. Here are some of the kind of ideas we are looking for.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frankensteins mobster</li>
                <li>Werewolf of wall street</li>
                <li>Vampire flapper</li>
                <li>The great Ghastby</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Anything you do that's classy-ish and has a monster theme should be fine. Lastly, make sure to show up right at 8! We only have 4 hours for this party and you wont want to miss any of it. :)</p>
