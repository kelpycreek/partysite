                            <h3 class="faq-title">I've never done this before, what should I expect?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Mostly just a really fancy costume party with some roleplaying elements. When you walk in the door you'll be handed a 'character.' A piece of paper with an idea of who you're supposed to be, some things you know, and a couple things your character wants to get done over the course of the night.</p>

                            <h3 class="faq-title">How intense is it?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Not. This is a decidedly laid back event that is welcoming of everyone, even if it's your first time roleplaying. You won't be expected to stay in character, and it's okay if you dont 'finish' all the things your character wants to do. </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="faq-title">But I still need to dress up?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">Yeah. You don't need to have a crazy amazing costume or be super on theme, but at its heart this is a party about pretending to be in a different place in a different world. Don't take away from that.</p>

                            <h3 class="faq-title">Whats the theme?</h3>
                            <p class="faq-text">This year we're travelling to The Dark Masquerade. Two noble families of vampires unite to invite all the creatures of the night to an underground masquerade ball where darkness, deception, and duplicity are the primary activities of the night. You don't HAVE to be a vampire, witches, werewolves, ghouls, and ghosts are all welcome at the Dark Masquerade. The story revolves around a family of vampires, so we'll need a critical mass of those; but we'll also need servants, villains, outcasts, privateers, etc. Free thinking is encouraged! If a picture is worth a thousand works, then surely <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/mkmford/murder-mystery/">a pinterest board is worth a million</a></p>

                            <p class="faq-text">Good counting. Yeah this is party 2/3 of my going away series. The final one will probably be a New Years Party, and then I'll leave forever :O</p>

                            <p class="faq-text">No. The 'Masquerade' theme is there in part to help people feel more comfortable wearing masks, but they wont be a requirement.</p>

                            <p class="faq-text">You get a free drink if you bring a negative covid test dated the 17th or later. I thought long and hard about requiring people to bring a negative test to the door, but at the end of the day I don't feel comfortable turning people away if they dont have a test result. HOWEVER, I would really, really appreciate it if you did bring a negative test.</p>
