                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Why are you charging?</span></h2>
                <p>Because throwing a party this size is expensive. The more I can crowdfund from the people who love it, the more often I can throw parties like this and the more I can provide when we do. I imagine that if this is wildly successful maybe next time we'll be able to provide food, or a bar tab, or a bigger and better venue for longer. I dont know! This is a big test run for me in those terms. That being said, I'm NOT throwing this to make money. I'll almost certainly end up in the hole several hundred dollars, not to mention the work I put into preperation. But having an experience like what I hope this turns out to be should make it all worth it!</p>

                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Im not having fun with my character.</span></h2>
                <p>If, for whatever reason, you find yourself at odds with your character, let me know and Ill replace it for you. It happens! Not everyone likes/knows what to do with each character, but we'll have some extras to make sure you have a good time. In fact, if anything goes wrong and you arent having fun, track me down and Ill make it right.</p>

                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Whats up with the Ritz Ticketz?</span></h2>
                <p>I wanted to give people who REALLY liked the idea and had some spare cash lying around a good place to say thanks. It's worth noting that if enough people get this ticket we can do some of the cool stuff I mentioned above. Here's what you get if you get the Ritz ticket:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I'll reach out to you and ask you what your costume is. If you're a vampire hunter in a zoot suit, then we'll make sure to give you a vampire hunter in a zoot suit character.</li>
                <li>You'll get a little ticket for a fancy drink.</li>
            </ul>
                <div class="cleaner faq"></div>
            
                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Can I volunteer?</span></h2>
                <p>Probably! If you're interested in helping make this a reality, I have a few things I need from volunteers. Greeting people who enter, distributing characters, maybe even some volunteer bartending. Also, if you have a financial problem with buying a ticket, volunteers get in free. Message me on facebook or text me at 425 583 1865 if you are interested.</p>

                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Do I NEED a costume?</span></h2>
                <p>I mean, I wont turn anyone away at the door. But c'mon, it's Halloween and its a murder mystery party. It'll be fun. You dont have to put in like a ton of effort. (kudos to anyone who does)</p>

                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Should I bring anything else?</span></h2>
                <p>It's a party, so snacks and booze is always appreciated. Just keep in mind we only have 4 hours!</p>
                <div class="cleaner"></div>
                <h2 class="nbd"><span>Can I invite other people?</span></h2>
                <p>Sure! Feel free to invite a couple of people, parties are always better with your friends. If you want to invite more then "a couple of people" let me know so I can plan accordingly.</p>
